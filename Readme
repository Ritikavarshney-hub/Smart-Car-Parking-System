##Smart Car Parking Lot System##

This project is a simple implementation of a Smart Car Parking Lot System using Arrays and Linked Lists.
It simulates how a real parking lot works by managing vehicle entry, exit, parking allocation, membership benefits, and billing.

The main goal of this project is to understand how basic data structures can be used to solve real-life problems.

About the Parking Lot

Total parking spaces: 50

Parking space IDs: 1 to 50

Parking space status:

0 → Free

1 → Occupied

Each parking space keeps track of how many times it was used and how much revenue it generated.

Vehicle Details Stored

For every vehicle, the system stores:

Vehicle number (unique)

Owner name

Arrival time

Departure time

Membership type (None / Premium / Golden)

Total parking hours

Number of times parked

Total amount paid

Allocated parking space ID

Entry Process

When a car enters the parking lot:

If the vehicle is entering for the first time, it is registered in the system and a parking space is allocated.

If the vehicle is already registered, the system searches using the vehicle number and updates the arrival time.

Parking space status is changed from free to occupied.

Entry is allowed only if a free parking space is available.

Exit Process

When a car exits:

Parking duration is calculated

Total parking hours are updated

Membership is upgraded if required

Parking fee is calculated

Membership discount is applied (if any)

Parking space is marked as free again

Parking Space Allocation

Golden members → Parking spaces 1 to 10

Premium members → Parking spaces 11 to 20

No membership → Parking spaces 21 to 50

The nearest available parking space is always allotted first.

Membership Rules

Less than 100 total hours → No membership

100 hours or more → Premium membership

200 hours or more → Golden membership

Payment Rules

₹100 for the first 3 hours

₹50 for every extra hour

10% discount for Premium and Golden members

Sorting Features

The system can:

Sort vehicles based on number of times parked

Sort vehicles based on total amount paid

Sort parking spaces based on how often they are occupied

Sort parking spaces based on revenue generated

Data Structures Used

Array → To manage parking spaces

Linked List → To store and manage vehicle records

Note:
This project is implemented only using Arrays and Linked Lists.

Purpose of the Project

To understand practical use of arrays and linked lists

To practice searching, updating, and sorting data

To simulate a real-world parking system using basic DSA concepts

Conclusion

This project shows how even simple data structures can be used to build a complete and functional system. It helped in understanding logic building, data handling, and system flow in a practical way.
